# Preface
* The FOURTH EDITION OF THIS BOOK includes many updates and additions that address the new professional realities faced by three-dimensional computer animators, techhnical directors, and visual effect artists. A lot has changed in this field since this book was first published in 1996. Many of these changes have transformed a field that began as a specialized novelty into a mainstream and mature profession.
* Consider the multiple landmark events that have taken place during the first decade of the 21st century. Desktop computers and graphics cards dominate today the production of computer animation, a world previously ruled by high-end (and high-priced) workstations. Computer networks and the Internet, including the development of streaming video on the World Wide Web, have also become ubiquitous during this period. The number of live-action feature films with significant, often stunning, three dimensional computer animation and visual effects has multiplied. The high power graphics capabilities of today's game consoles are capable of rendering in real time very sophisticated imagery. high definition digital video is a feasible means of moving production, and all digital cinema continues to evolve. The quality of work produced by computer animation and film-making students continues to rise worldwide, with student short films winning countless prestigious awards. Computers are used for virtually every single animated movie, game, or TV series produced today, and it seems like the first all-computer-animated movie, game, or TV series produced today, and it seems like the first all-computer-animated feature film was produced a long time ago, before some of this book's readers were born. 
* Some of the new material that you will find in the book includes:

        * Additional new pages focusing on creative development, story, visual style, and characters.
        * Information on new production pipelines
        * An expanded version of the popular historical timeline of computer animation, visual effects, and technology, including the recent years.
        * over 300 new color images with informative captions, including first-time contributions from Australia, Croatia, Czech, Finland, India, Israel, Hollywood studios, and production houses and independents in Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.
        * New animation principles of anime
        * Updated animation chapters with a focus on blending the traditional animation principles with the digital crafts
        * Countless tips on how to improve the artistic and technical quality of your projects.
        * Updated technical information on the latest stylistic trends and techniques.
        * An updated website at ***www.artof3d.com** containing parts of the book that are available only online, such as the much-read Ten Tips for Digital Artists, and other useful resources.

## Scope of this book
* It would require an encyclopedic work to fully document and present all of the topics and techiques included in this subject. This book does not pretend to be such a work. A significant effort has been made to create a book that is not bound by the particulars of any specific computer program while, at the same time, offers detailed, practical information that goes beyond merere theory. The knowledge contained in this book has been distilled from years of production experience, working and teaching with a variety of software programs, from reading innumerable software manuals, and from practicing and making mistakes. Hopefully, reading this book will help minimize the number of mistakes you make and provide you with the tools to gracefullly recover from them. Welcome to artistic production.

## How to Read this Book
* Mastering the art and craft of three-dimensional computer animation and effects can be achieved in different ways. Likewise, this book can be read in multiple ways.
* For those of you who like the systematic approach I recommend that you read the book from front to back in sequential order, and refer to the illustrations to complement the knowledge presented in the main body of the text.
* for those of you who prefer to learn by doing or are too impatient to read the whole book from start to end, it might be best to look at the picture first. But do not forget to read the captions as you look at the images. There is a lot of useful information contained in them. You might want to read some of the sections in the book that complement the step-by-step procedures that you can find in your software manual. This book contains information rarely found in manuals or presented by instructors in lab courses. This information is more important than it seems at first because it will help you make the transition from being just a technician (AKA button-pusher) in the software program of your choice to being a creative digital animator or artist.

## using this book with Software
* Read the book as you learn and experiment with a specific three-dimensional program or by itself without any hands-on work. To those of you who prefer to learn by reading before you start the hands-on part of learning, this book offers a comprehensive introduction with plenty of theoretical and practice references. Those of you who prefer diving straight into the particulars of a specific computer program--and reading after the fact--will find this book complements your experimental approach by offering clear explanations in a succinct form. Last but not least, to those of you who learn best by combining the experimental approach with conceptual comprehension, this book offers a logical progression of topics that goes beyond the particulars of software manual.

## Book Format
* This book consists of five sections, each with several chapters. The first section includes a historical overview and general creative development and production issues. This section deals with a summary of the major creative and technical trends, a short summary of computer animation and visual effects milestones, and advice regarding the production planning of a project. The introductory section makes you think like a historian, film critic, and producer. Section II goes right into the details of modeling three-dimensional objects and environments. The modeling section makes you think like a sculptor. Section III covers many of the most useful rendering techniques, both simple and complex. The rendering section makes you think like a photographer and painter. The fourth section deals first with many of the issues associated with telling a story through performance, moving pictures and visual effects: basic screenplay writing, storyboarding, and acting techniques for bringing an animated character to life. The animation section makes you think like an actor, a scriptwriter, and a cinematographer. The last section presents issues involved in recording and presenting your work, including sequencing and composing. This section makes you think like an editor and a magician who pulls off the trick right in front of the audience.

## What to Expect from this Book
* This book seeks to inspire and to inform. It presents the concepts required to understand the steps and procedures that lead to the completion of a film, rendered three-dimensional computer animation. Many of illustrations have been developed to present complex concepts in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Considerable effort has also been made so that the book structure and details would be as inclusive as possible: many software programs and hardware platforms were tested and reviewed so that readers find a consistent treatment and point of view. The main goal of this book is to provide the reader with a solid foundation by presenting a unique and unusual combination of technique and creativity.

## What Not to Expect from this Book
* This book is not a computer software manual. It is not based on a particar software program. Readers who seek information regarding the detailed operation of specific software or the implementation of specific techniques are advised to consult software manuals. This book is not a general introduction to the use of computers. it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the basic use of a computer system, or that the reader is in the process of gaining that knowledge elsewhere. Readers who have used computers and who have a basic understanding of the operation of computer systems and are likely to benefit from this book faster than readers who have never before used a computer.

## About Software Manuals
* Software manuals are sometimes tedious to follow and they become obsolete in a flash. The latter is not surprising if we take into account the complexity of software, the constant upgrades of features, adn short production cycles to develop the software and relevant manuals, and turning them into functional and efficient products within a competitive market.
* Having been both a user and a writer of software user manuals I am familiar with the frustrations experienced by both sides. Today's three-dimensional software is so complex and changing that we can not expect a manual to have every single pice of information perfectly digested and updated. My advice is to take the useful information contained in the software manuals and build on it. Some of the nuts and bolts information required to be a proficient digital animator and technician is found in manuals. Some is acquired through practice, trial, and error, or from reading books and magazines and consulting with individuals more experienced than oneself. Learning requires effort.

## General Principles vs. Specific Techniques
* Most of the techniques described throughout the book are available in most of the three-dimensional software programs available on the market. But instead of presenting these modeling, rendering, animation, and output techniques in exactly the same ways they are implemented in a specific computer system, we present them by focusing on their essential features and capabilities. Specific implementations of techniques--implementations that differ from system to system--are left untouched. Readers who wish to obtain highly specific information regarding a particular computer program mentioned in this book are advised to consult their specific software reference manuals.

SECTION I: INTRODUCTION

# Chapter I: Animation and Visual Effects in Context
Summary
* The brief historical information presented here provides readers with a simple context in which to frame technique and stylistic discussion related to three-dimensional computer animation and visual effects. A summary of events and projects that contributed to the creative and technical development of three-dimensional computer animation and digital visual effects techniques is presented in this chapter.

## 1.1 A Digital Creative Environment
* More than ever before computers have become part of our life, especial part of our creative, production, and professional lives. They can be found everywhere: they coordinate the flow of information in our banking transaction, they digitize our voices and filter the noise in telephone conversations, they control the fuel injection system in our cars, and they adjust the setting in photograhpic and video cameras so that image quality is always optimal. Most of the job in the visual professions and trades today require some degree of computer competency. Much of the broadcasting, manufacturing, graphic arts, and entertainment industries have computerized their production. Likewise, many independent artists and design studios develop their work with computers and often deliver it in digital formats.
* The transition to increased reliance on computer system affects many creators and technicians. Large numbers of established visual professionals have retrained to acquire new skills, and young students are eager to learn the secrets and shortcuts. Expectations range from the sensible to the ridiculous. Those who resist the change altogether, for example, are left behind because the world of animation production is changing. Those who are overly enthusiastic often have unrealistic expectations. By finding a balance we can accept the advantages that computer technology has to offer while retaining and developing the knowledge that we inherited from traditional practitioners.
* Much of today's creation and production of images is indeed performeed with the aid of computers. Increasingly, professionals from a wide variety of visual disciplines are working with **digital information**. Some of the traditional visual practices based on drawing, painting, photography, and video techniques are merging with **digitial imaging techniques**. A creative environment that used to exist as a collection of totally separate and unrelated disciplines--each with its own tools, techniques, and media--is turning into an environment where visual people use tools and techniques that cross over different media. As a result some of the traditional barriers between visual disciplines no longer have to exist. There is now, for example, great overlap between the fields of animation, graphic arts, broadcasting, and film. The creative **digital environment** has fostered this overlap because computer technology often provides more creative power to visual people. Decades ago, for example, visual professionals used to purchase tools specialized for their professions. These tools were useful for doing the work in their field, but not in others. A photographer, for example, would use a photographic camera to capture reality on film, and a traditional animator would use a pencil and light table to create animated sequences of drawing on paper. Today's photographer and animators, as well as many other creative professionals, share the computer as the tool--loaded with specialized software--to carry on each of their unique tasks.

#### Animation and Effects in the Predigital Days
* For many of us it is difficult to imagine today that only a few decades ago all animation, effects, and entertainment in general was made, distributed, and consumed without any type of computer or digital technology. But this was the case even a few decades ago. One of the first fully three-dimensional computer animated independent shorts, John lasseter's Luxo Jr., was released in 1986, and the first fully three-dimensional computer animated feature film, Pixar's Toy Story, was released in 1995.
* As we experiment with new modeling, rending, and animation techniques it is also worthwhile to remember the innovation of many of the animation and those who pioneered the use of experimental methods such as collage, cutouts, wax, pinhead shadow, object, and abstract painting animation. Among the former we count the New York and Hollywood animators who devlier gag after gag and amused audiences with the likes of Popeye, Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry, and Mickey Mouse. These animators include **Max Fleischer, Walt Disney, Walter Lantz, Tex Avery, Friz Freleng, Chuck Jones,** and the many talented animators who worked alongside them in their studios. Among the experimental animators we count the French Leopold Survage and Alexander Alexeieff; the Germans Hans Richter, Oskar Fischinger, and Lotte Reininger; the Canadian Norman Mclaren; and the American Claire Parker and John Witney, Sr. The classic Disney animated movies that popularized the genre were created in the late 1930s and 1940s. The well-known twelve principles of animation covered in Chapter 10 were also developed by Disney animators during the same time period, fifty years before computer animation started to be used in their animation studios.
* As we seek to invent new digital visual effects it is refreshing to remember that in 1939 Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) created the Special Effects category in their awards competition. Between 1964 and 1971 the category was renamed Special Visual Effects, and between 1972 and 1976 the category of visual effects was renamed as Special Achievement Award, one not necssarily given in a particular year. Since then the category has mostly been called Visual Effects. Winners between 1939 and 2003 are listed in the timelines at the end of this chapter.
* If we go back a bit further, just to put three-dimensional computer animation in perspective, we find out that the first kinetoscope parlor opened in New York City in 1894, 101 years before the release of Toy Story. This event was the result of the work of Thomas Alva Edison and his assistant William K. Dickinson to improve the devices for creating images in motion and, above all, the simultaneous recording of sound and motion. Edison and his assistant developed the **kinetoscope**--which means "viewing in motion"" in Greek--a closed box in which 50 feet of looped film could be viewed through an opening. The few kinetoscope equipped with earphones to hear simultaneous music were called kinetophones. A few years later on the other side of the Atlantic, during the 1900 Paris Exhibition, a mechanical platform gently rocked by a steam machine presented riders with panoramic views of real and imaginary scenes of the world. These panoramic rides so popular at the turn of the nineteenth century are clearly the ancestors of virtual rides and location-based entertainment. In retrospect it is clear that the kinetoscope spawned many other film viewing and projection system that fueled the growth of the **seventh art**, cinema, and its animation cousin.

### 1.2 The Development of the Technology
* Computers, particularly their visual capabilities, are profoundly altering the way in which we create and distribute images. but the powerful computer systems that are so common today--and that everybody takes for granted--have existed for a relative short period of time.
* The ancestors of today's electronic digital computers were mechanical adding machines used to perform repetitive arithmetic calculations. Those early mechanical devices eventually evolved into machines that could be programmed each time they were used to perform different sets of instructions. In the 1940s, electric versions of these computing machines were in operation.
* The early computer models were called **mainframe** because all their bulky components were housed in large steel frames. During the 1960s two types of computers were developed. **Minicomputers**, smaller and less expensive than mainframes but almost as powerful, were developed in an attempt to bring computers to a wider audience and range of applications. **Supercomputers**, usually bigger and more expensive than mainframe computers, were developed to tackle the most taxing computing projects regardless of the cost and with an emphasis of speed and performance.
* Before the mid-1970s the large majority of artists found computers very uninteresting. They were too expensive and cumbersome to operate, and even the simplest tasks required extensive programming. Most models lacked monitors, printers, mice, or graphics tablets. **Microcomputers** with million of microscopic electronic switches on a single **silicon chip** were developed in the mid-1970s. Some early models of microcomputers, such as the Apple Macintosh, the AMniga, and a variety of Intel-based PC computers, were widely embraced by visual professionals during the 1980s. Many of today's powerful microcomputers are small enough to be carried in a bag or briefcase. Those that can fit in a pocket still have limited capabilities for professional image creation, but many are quite good at displaying moving images of different degrees of quality. The supermicrocomputer and the parallel computer were developed during the 1980s and had a great effect on the way visual people use computers. **Super-microcomputers**--also called **workstations**--are microcomputers built around a powerful CPU that is customized to excel in the performance of a specific task, for example, three-dimensional computer animation. **Massively parallel computers** deal with very complex processing challenges by dividing up the tasks among a large number of small microprocessors. Some of these computers may have between a dozen and thousands of processors.
* **Computer graphics technology** was developed in the early 1950s to make visible what was invisible to the human eye. Most of these early applications were related to the military, manufacturing, or the applied sciences and included, for example, flight simulators to train figher pilots without having to fly a real plane; computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM) systems to allow electrical engineers to design and test electronic circuits with millions of components; and computer-aided tomography (CAT) scanners to allow physicians to peek into the human body without having to physically open it. None of the early computer graphics systems was developed for artistic work.
* During the 1950s and 1960s, the early years of computer graphics technology, the computer systems and techniques for creating images were rudimentary and very limited--especially by today's standards. During that period very few artists and designers even knew that computers could be used to create images.
* During the 1970s and 1980s computer technology becam more practical and useful, and a significant number of visual creators started to get interested in using computers. During the 1990s a significant drop in the prices of computer systems and an increase in their computing power occured. This situation encouraged many visual professionals to purchase the technology and to integrate it into their daily professional practices. Professionals from all visual disciplines accepted computer technology as it became more powerful, more practical, and less expensive. *Many of the major technical innovation in the area of computer animation and related applications have traditionally been presented at the **SIGGRAPH** annual conference*. Sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group in Graphics, SIGGRAPH has been the most influential professional association in the field of computer animation since the 1960s. Figure 1.2.1 lists the international computer animation projects awarded at SIGGRAPH's screenings since the inception of the awards. It also lists some of the computer science and engineering pioneers in the field of computer graphics as recognized by their peers through the SIGGRAPH awards. Some of the research papers and innovations of these technical pioneers can be found in the conference proceedings.
* The computer technology necessary for creating three-dimensional imagery and animation has evolved tremendously since the first systems were developed in the 1950s. Within just a few decades the capabilities of hardware and software for creating three-dimensional environments went from simple to highly complex representations that often fool our visual perception.
* A computer history of three-dimensional computer graphics technology and creative works remains to be written. However, the information presented in the rest of this chapter summarizes some of the highlights and landmarks. This summary is certainly not exhaustive, and it does not attempt to present a complete and detailed portrait of all the significant events. Instead, it provides a personal account of individual examples and a summary of the major trends.

### Technical Developments: 1950s and 1960s
* The decades of the 1950s and 1960s saw the development of the first interactive computer systems, which were further improved during the following decade. The field of computer graphics was so new then, and most of the technological innovations from this period did not yield spectacular visual results. These innovations were, however, fundamental in facilitating the impressive developments that would flourish 20 years later.
* The first computer to use CRT displays as output peripherals was the Whirlwind computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the early 1950s. This system was used to display the solutionws to differential equations on oscilloscope monitors. During the mid- to late-1950s the SAGE Air Defence System of the U.S. Air Force used command-and-control CRT displays on which operators could detect aircraft flying over the continental United States. The SAGE operators were also able to obtain information about the aircraft by pointing at their icons on the screen with light pens.
* During the 1960s various technology-intensive organizations developed the first **computer-aided design and manufacturing (CADAM)** systems. The goal of these early CADAM systems was to make the design process more effective by offering users sophisticated design functions and to improve the organization of the manufacturing process by linking the numerical data that represents an image with other types of information, such as inventory and engineering analysis. One of the first CADAM systems was developed by General Motors, and it included various time-sharing graphic stations for designing cars. Other companies, including Boeing Aerospace, IBM, McDonnell Douglas, General Electric, and Lockheed, developed similar systems.
* Early attempts to create computer-generated movies took place in several research institutions. Short pieces of animation were produced at Boeing by William Fetter and Walter Bernhart in the early 1960s. Three-dimensional drawing were plotted on paper and filmed one at a time to produce animations of an aircraft carrier landing. Fetter also modeled the human figure for ergonomic studies related to the design of cockpits. At Bell Laboratories, researchers Michael noll and Bela Julesz produced various stero computer animations on film to aid in the study of stereo perception. During this period some of the first animation programming languages were developed, but most of them resulted in programs that ran only in noninteractive mode.
* Only a few commercial companies were involved in computer graphics research during these two decades. Most of the technological developments during this period came out of government-funded academic research laboratories such as MIT's Lincoln Labs.
* In the early 1960s, computer graphics were developed to visualize objects and situations that were too costly or just impossible to represent otherwise. Flight simulators, CADAM systems, and CAT scanners were among the pioneering computer graphics systems.
* The first interactive system, called **Sketchpad**, was developed in the early 1960s by Ivan Sutherland at MIT. This system allowed users to interact with simple wireframe object via a light pen. This system made use of several new interaction techniques and new data structures for dealing with visual information. It was an interactive design system with capabilities for the manipulation and display of two- and three-dimensional wireframe objects.
* By the mid-1960s the first algorithms for removal of hidden surfaces were developed, and the systems for producing full-color surface-shaded animation in real time were improved. General Electric developed a flight simulator that animated and dsiplayed simultaneously as many as 40 solid objects with hidden surfaces removed and in full color. The Mathematical Application Group, Inc. (MAGI) in Elmsford, New York, was one of the first companies that offered computer-generated animation of fully rendered polygonal objects in the commercial environment. Their process was named **Synthavision**, and its first contracts included simulations for the military and advertising-related projects.
* The early three-dimensional computer animation and imaging systems depended on costly mainframe computers that were slow by today's standards. Most of the program would run only on a specific type of computer and display device, and were not portable to other systems. The use of computer graphic systems during the 1960s was restricted by the high cost and limitations of the hardware involved.
* Virtually all of the graphics software from this period was developed in-house. It was not marketed, and it was minimally documented. Most programs were executed in the batch mode, and very few had any interactive features at all. users had to input their data almost exclusively through the keyboard; other types of input peripherals that encouraged more artistic freedom were just not available. A few computer systems had graphics screens, but most had monochrome alphanumeric CRT screens or just teletype or dot matrix printers.

### Technical Development: 1970
* The 1970s was a significant decade for the development of computer animation and imaging technology. Many of the basic rendering techniques still in use today were forumulated during the 1970s. The minicomputers that became popular during the 1970s were easier to maintain than mainframe computers, and provided significantly more power at a reduced cost. Microcomputer technology was also introduced to the consumer markets in the late part of the decade.
* From the point of view of computer hardware, most of the research and production work done during this decade was based on minicomputers. The microcomputer's 8-bit computing power, memory capabilities, and output solution was insignificant when compared to their high-end counterparts. But in the videogames arena the new microcomputers greatly contributed to the popularization of computer-generated graphics. A standard configuraiton of an early 1970s microcomputer included 8-bit CPU without any graphics co-processor, less than 100 KB of RAM memory, a clock speed of 10 MHz, a low resolution screen with a maximum palette of 8 colors (or slightly higher if dithering was used), and a limited amount of peripheral storage.
* During this decade the University of Utah became a primordial force and a center of innovation in three-dimensional computer graphics research. Under the guidance of David Evans, co-founder of Evans & Sutherland, the Department of Computer Science at the University of Utah produced a distinguished roster of Ph.D students. Many of them developed a large number of the major technical contributions of the decade, such as the original versions of polygonal, Gouraud, and Phong shading; image and bump texture mapping; z-buffering; the subdivision and the painter's algorithms for hidden line removal; antialiasing methods; and hand and facial computer animation.

### Technical Developments: 1980s
* It was during the 1980s when computer graphics technology leaped from being a curiosity into becoming an area of proven artistic and commercial potential. Technologically speaking, this decade started with the uneven coexistence between powerful minicomputer systesm and 8-bit microcomputers. But the decade ended with a new breed of powerful 32-bit microcomputers and 64-bit RISC (reduced instruction set computer) graphics workstations at the forefront, and with minicomputers in the back seat. Silicon Graphics Inc., the company that pioneered visual workstations with its **Geometry Engine**, was started by James Clark in 1982. Commercially speaking, this decade started with a handful of companies that pioneered the production of three-dimensional computer animation and imaging. These companies included Digitual Effects and MAGI on the East Coast and Robert Abel Associates and Information International, Inc (III) on the West Coast. These companies operated exclusively with software developed in-house and with much custom-built graphics hardware. The 1980s concluded with the closing of all of the pioneer production houses--or at least of their production divisions--and with the creation of a new group of smaller, leaner, and more market-oriented firms that operated mostly with off-the-shelf hardware and with a mixture of custom and off-the-shelf software.
* The bulk of the software research and development during this decade was spent in refining the modeling and shading techniques inherited from the 1970s. Ground was broken with new rendering approaches such as radiosity and procedural textures, and with the development of the first generation computer animation and human interfaces for three-dimensional computer animation and imaging software. The **RenderMan** shading language was released by Pixar in 1988. Some of the software companies that pioneered the high-end tools for three-dimensional computer animation and visual effects production were founded during this period. In 1981 Wavefront opened in Santa Barbara, California. In 1982 Alias opened in Toronto, Softimage in Montreal, and Mental Images in Berlin in 1986. Side Effects Software opened in Toronto in 1987.
* Some of the leading academic centers in North America involved in three-dimensional graphics research during this period included **Cornel University (radiosity rendering techniques), the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology (motion dynamics), the University of California at Berkeley (spline modeling), Ohio State University (hierarchical character animation and inverse kinematics), the University of Toronto (procedural techniques), the University of Montreal (character animation and lip syncing), and New York University (procedural textures). Significant original research efforts also took place at the University of Tokyo and Osaka University (modeling with blobby surfaces), and the University of Hiroshima (radiosity and lighting).** A few research centers and private companies invested significant resources in the development and production of shorts that pushed computer graphics technology to its limits. Government-sponsored research centers also developed pioneering simulation techniques. Figure 1.2.8 shows a landmark simulation of natural forces. Most of the three-dimensional software products that were commercially available during the first half of this decade lagged behind the exciting work done in research institutions. This was partly due to the lack of capital investors who believed in the commercial potential of the technology. It was also due to the difficulty of implementing computing-intensive techniques with off-the-shelf hardware systems that were not quite as fast as needed and perhaps a bit overpriced.
* Some of the hardware research during the 1980s focused on the development of more powerful general-purpose microprocessors and special-purpose graphics processors, and techniques for the high-speed transfer of visual data. A standard midrange computer system for three-dimensional computer animation production during the 1980s, for example, comsisted of a 32- or 64-bit microcomputer or supermicrocomputer with one or several graphics processors, clock speeds higher than 50Mhz, several dozens of megabytes for RAM memory, and extensive peripheral storage.
* In terms of output standards, few of the production companies at the beginning of the decade were capable of first-generation output to videotape. Most of the high-end work was output to film first and then transferred to videotape. By the end of the decade, however, video output established itself as a common output method for computer-generated animation.

#### Technical Developments: Early 1990s
* The first half of the 1990s witnessed a major move toward smaller and/or considerably more powerful computer systems. Virtually all of the low-end microcomputers currently in production are based on 32-bit microprocessors, whereas the pwoerful microcomputer models are centered around 64-bit CISC and RISC processors. A considerable number of models with different features were targeted at different segments of the market, especially systems with multiple processors, and computer systems were sold in a modular form. Supermicrocomputers, or workstations, kept increasing in power while decreasing in price, or remained at the same price level but with additional features.
* Research and development was mostly centered around issues of efficiency, cost and ease of use. With the midrange hardware systems being powerful enough for most creative needs, a lot of energy and time was spent in optimizing the software techniques. Taking small solid steps took precedence over making large groundbreaking advances. Computer-human interface issues also took precedence in this buyer's market. users of three-dimensional software became increasingly sophisticated and demanding, and enjoyed new levels of creativity and computing power. Two additional trends of this period include the rebirth of the electronic game industry (and the growth in jobs, volume, and quality associated with it), as well as the fact that, overall, the computer industry became friendlier and less technical as it tried to mass-market its products to the consumer market.

#### Technical Developments: Late 1990s
* During the second half of the 1990s the worlds of computer animation and visual effects production were impacted by the many changes and technological advances that took place in the computer hardward and software industries. Some of the more influential events include the popularization of the **Window NT** and **Linux** computer operating systems. This trend evolved to a point where even SGI, the computer company formerly known as Silicon Graphics, Inc. and a traditional stalward of the **UNIX** operating system, began offering NT-based computers in 1999. CPU clock speeds used for production continued to move up, with speeds of 400 and 500 MHz becoming common. Intel and its Pentium line and processors became a significant player in production environments where years earlier they had been dismissed as lightweights. Powerful graphics co-processors designed to accelerate the speed of three-dimensional computations also continued to evolve. Some ended up being bundled on PC motherboards, and others continued to be sold as add-on graphics cards. Computer networksf became vital to digital production due to the popularization of rendering farms and production in multiple locations. By the end of the decade the use of company **computer intranets** for communication and file transfer and management became the standard practice at most leading centers of digital production.
* Major advances in the video industry also had an impact on computer animation and visual effect production. **Digital video** became a reality in the mid-1990s, and by the end of the decade different types of productions had been realized in the new medium. Late in the decade Sony introduced a **high definition digital video** camera, and in 1999 the company announced that a 24-frame-per-second version (24P HD) was in development. In the same year the filmmaker George Lucas made statements about his plans to shoot live action with such a camera in the second Star Wars prequel. The success of 1999 independent films like The Blair With Project and the Danish The Celebration popularized the acceptance of digital video for maintream production. These two live action films were shot on digital video (the former used only available light) and transfer to 35mm film for theatrical release. The increasingly widespread availably of 24P HD digital video promises to simplify some production issues in the area of visual effects.
* The advent of **digital movie projectors** was another significant development of the late 1990s because it pointed to the fact that one day photographic film might no longer be the dominant medium for motion pictures and animation, not only for home use but also for theatrical releases. Texas Instruments became an early leader in the field of digital projectors when it introduced its first DLP model in 1998.
* The great popularity and growth experienced by **computer games** and **platform games** translated into many jobs for three-dimensional computer animators, who created hundreds of real-time and prerendered games for personal computers and new game platforms such as Sony's **PlayStation**, the **Nintendo 64**, and Sega's **Dreamcast**. The arcade version of Virtua Figher 3 released by Sega in 1996 brought arcade games to a new level of polygon real-time rendering performance. But the new home console game systems continued to become more sophisticated. The game industry during the 1990s wrapped up with a great demand for computer animators and several exciting games.
* In the area of software tools, there were several significant development during the late 1990s. The modeling technique of subdivision surfaces allows users to build three-dimensional models with variable geometry resolutions throughout the model. This technique was developed at the University of Washington and then perfected at Pixar, where the 1997 award-winner Geri's Game became the test-bed for this modeling technique. **The technique of image-based rendering, refined at The University of California at Berkeley, facilitates the reconstruction of three-dimensional environments based on photographic references taken on location. Nonphotorealistic rendering is used to represent three-dimensional geometry with a two-dimensional look. Applications of this approach are of great interest to technical illustrator** and to those looking for ways to visually integrate traditional animation and three-dimensional computer animation. The simulation of water and gas dynamics and brittle matter also gained ground during this period.

#### Technical Developments: Early 2000s
* Hardware continued its march toward smaller, faster, and cheaper. Graphics boards with powerful GPU made hardware rendering a reality, both for professional applications and home entertainment. The game industry benefited from this increased computing power for the playback of real-time three-dimensional computer animation. Powerful home game consoles proliferated. In 2000, for example, Sony introduced the PlayStation 2, a system build around a 128-bit processor that draws 2 million polygons per frame, which is about the geometry resolution of an average scene in the 1995 ToyStory animated feature film. Microsoft introduced the Xbox powered by an Nvidia graphics card capable of drawing up to 125 million polygons per second, and Nintendo introduced the GameCube. The competition for revenues between the computer and platform games and movie box office continued.
* Processors for PCs moved to speed closer to and beyond 2 gigahertz (GHz). Intel's Pentium 4 Processor, for example, debuted in 2000 with an initial speed of 1.5 GHz--compare that to Intel's first microprocessor, the 4004, which ran at 108 KHz! If automobile speed had increased similarly over the same period, you could now drive drom San Francisco to New York in about 13 seconds. AMD introduced their 64-bit processor in 2003. 64-bit processors have attracted interested from software developers and Mental Ray is an early 64-bit renderer. In the area of operating systems, relative newcomer Linux became the dominant standard for high-end production, while Mac OSX gained a fair amount of attention and use because of its UNIX-like features.
* High-definition video (HD) continued to develop with the successful completion of all-digital productiosn such as Star Wars: Episode II and Spy Kid 2. Different flavors of HD cameras continued to be introduced, most notably Thompson's Viper FilmStream in 2002, prototypes by Olympus and JVC, as well as Sony's 1080p HD camera system, the F950 CineAlta with a 2/3 in. sensor and 4:4:4 full-RGB bandwidth, and the imprved HDCAM-SR tape format with 4:2:2 10-bit color bandwidth. At the same time the use of digital dailies and the digital intermediate process gained converts in teh worlds of movie and TV post-production. File formats for compressing and decompressing files sent via computer networks developed significantly. These formats, known as **codecs**, are especially useful for video streaming and resulted in new version of Apple's Quicktime, Microsoft's Media Player 9, and a few others based on the MPEG-4 video compression standard (read Chapter 15 for more information on compression).
* The proliferation of DVD players in the home video comsumer market during the early 2000s helped fuel a massive distribution of the computer-animated and visual effects "hits" of the period. A Hollywood Reporter survey in 2003, for example, indicated a 65 percent increase in DVD purchase between 2001 and 2002. VHS sales declined an estimated 29 percent during the same period.

#### Technical Developments: Late 2000s
* The seventh generation of game platforms was released in the middle of the decade with impressive specs. In 2005, for example, Microsoft introduced the XBox 360 capable of rendering 500 million triangles per second. Nintendo released the Wii also in 2005, based on a RISC IBM PowerPC processor and an ATI Hollywood graphics card, and Sony followed up with the PlayStation 3 in 2006. Computer and graphics cards manufacturers continued to offer faster and more powerful systems. In 2006 Nvidia graphics card manufacturer started to distribute a free version of their hardware renderer **Gelato** with native 64-bit support. Also in 2006 CPU manufacturer AMD merged with graphics card manufacturer ATI Technologies, and scheduled a new product that merges a CPU and a GPU for 2009 release. Nvidia has also announced a planned integration of a CPU and a GPU on a single chip. In 2006 Apple Computer switched to Intel CPU for its line of Macintosh computers and servers.
* On the digital cinematography front a variety of new high-definition camera were introduced or improved. Many of these non film-based cameras are increasingly used for recording commercials or live action features, particularly those with a large number of visual effects. The **Red One** camera is notable for its high resolution and its relative low price. The Red One camera was released in 2007 with a 24.4 x 13.7 mm 12-megapixel sensor delivering a 4096 x 2304 pixel image. Effects movie Jumper (2008) and Guerrilla and The Argentine (2008), both directed by Steven Soderbergh, were shot with the Red One. In 2004 Panavision introduced the Genesis camera with a single 12.4-megapixel sensor and 4:4:4 color bandwidth. It was first used in 2006 to shoot effects feature Superman Returns, Scary Movie 4, adn Apocalyto, adn in 2008 to record Asterix in the Olympic Game. In 2007 Dalsa introduced the Origin II camera with a resolution of 4046 x 2048 pixels and the ability to output uncompressed 16-bit image files, yielding very wide dynamic range. The James Bond movie Quantum of Solace (2008) includes a visual effects shot captured with eight Dalsa cameras shooting simultaneously and with synchronized shutters. Arriflex introduced in 2005 its D-20 camera featuring a 1920-1080 pixel resolution in 4:4:4 10-bit format. Vision Research offers the **Phantom HD** high-speed camera also capable of 2K resolution and frame rates ranging from 1 to 1000 fps at 14-bit depth per channel.
* On the consumer front YouTube launched in 2005 as a video sharing website that has allowed animation and effects professionals to easily showcase their work, and has also brought a lot of animation to mainstream viewers. Google's Image Search became a useful visual research tool and in 2005 it reached 1.1 billion images indexed. Google acquired Youtube in 2006. The Blu-ray Disc became in 2008 the high-capacity de facto standard for DVD format: it can store up to 50 GB in dual layer mode.

### 1.3 Visual Milestones: 1960-1989
* It is both refreshing and illuminating to view, enjoy, and analyze the visual works that became creative milestones in the development of three-dimensional computer animation and imaging. By analyzing these works we can learn about all the computer animation techniques and styles that have evolved into what this field is today.
* Useful sources for learning more about computer animation and visual effects include the **SIGGRAPH Video Review** DVDs, issues of the Cinefex journal of visual effects, and the winners and runner-ups of the American **Acadamy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)** awards in the Best Visual Effects and Best Animated Feature, and best Animated Shot categories (see listings in the timelines at the end of this chapter). Visit the **www.artof3d.com** website for links to these sources, as well as other useful computer animation resources and links.

#### Visual Milestones: 1960
* During most of the 1960s the computer was--in the opinion of most visual artists, critics, and spectators--too cold and technical to be involved in the creation of artistic projects. Similar prejudeces about technology arose in the nineteen century when machines were introduced on a massive scale to the industrial world. Many turn-of-the-century painters feared the new technology until they learned how to use it and became creative with it. During the 19060s the impact and influence of computers on animation and imaging can be compared to the impact photography had on the visual arts of the late nineteenth century. Miniature painters and engravers feared that the new invention would replace them, and some of them even called it the "invention of the devil". Most new technologies that prove useful eventually become everyday technologies.
* As mentioned earlier, computers have been used to creat images since the 1950s, but the first artistic experiments with computer-based systems did not take place until the early 1960s. Most of the early animations and images produced with computers were not created in art studios but in research laboratories, and mostof them used two-dimensional techniques at first. In fact, an unlikely partnership between Bell Lab physicists Billy Kluver and artist Robert Rauschenbert resulted in the 1967 Experiment in Art and Technology in New York City. But for the most part, the majority of individuals who created the early works of computer animation came from fields of science and engineering, and lacked formal training the in fine arts. Nevertheless, many fo them displayed a strong artistic intention and a significant degree of aesthetic consciousness.
* The computer systems that were used by these pioneers were not designed primarily for artistic creation. The IBM model 360 introduced in 1963, for example, was the first family of computers centered around the Fortran-based time-sharing system. Compared to today's computers, systems of those years were not very interactive, if they were interactive at all. The computer-human interface of the 1960s was typically opaque, cryptic, and not self-explanatory.
* Using the early computer systems to create animations and images was not easy, so many of these early creators often had to put more effort into the process of cerating the works than into the form and content of the works themselves. A few early computer artists were more concerned with the development of the computer-based imaging tools than with the style of their work. But in spite of all the limitations, the pioneers made effective use of the available technology.
* The early computer-generated animations and images are the products of a technology still in the stage of development. The style of these early works was defined in the stage of development. The style of these early works was defined in a major way by the limitations of the computer equipment itself, and by the lack of computer programs that were capable of rendering complex images in a variety of ways. Very often complex methods and data structures did not yield correspondingly complex images. Among the American pioneers of computer art we can mention John Whitney, Sr., and Charles Csuri whose early computer-assisted animations date, respectively, from 1961 and 1966.
* One of the earliest experiments with computer-generated character animation was Mr. Commputer Image ABC created in 1962 by Lee Harrison III with Scanimate system at Computer Image Corporation (the system won an Emmy Award in 1972)
* In 1968 the **Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)** introduced a new rating system for movies that impacted the work done by filmmakers and animators. This rating system included four categories: G (General Audiences), M (Mature Audiences), R (Restricted), and X(No one under 17). A short time later the M rating was replaced by PG (Parental Guidance). Figure 1.3.11 presents today's updated listing of ratings across the major entertainment media.

#### Visual Milestones: 1970s
* The panorama in computer art changed greatly during the 1970s because of the development of techniques for representing three-dimensional environments and because of the increased involvement of professional artists with computers. Computer-based animation and imaging systems beccame more interactive than what they were during the 1960s, but they were still not easy to use. Only a few of the artists who got interested in computer technology used it as their primary medium for artistic creation. In additionto their visual work, many of these early artists of three-dimensional computer animation and imaging also contributed to the technical development of these tools by collaborating in the development of software.
* One of the most widely viewed works of three-dimensional computer animation during the late 1970s was Voyager 2, created by James Blinn and a team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. This work visualized the explorations of the Voyager 2 spaceship, and iti s an excellent example of one of the earliest successful and extensive uses of image mapping techniques. Artist David Em, a visiting artist at JPL, created stills of fantastic planets with the same software used by scientists to render the planets of the Solar System.
* Other notable examples of computer animation from this period include the 1974 animated film Hunger creeated by Peter Foldes under the auspices of the National Film Board of Canada. This work included striking computer-generated interpolations of key poses drawn by hand and painstakingly digitized into the computer software. Vol Libre, a three-dimensional computer animation by Loren Carpenter, shows renderings of fractal mountains with great lyrical force. The Joggler is an early example of a computer-animated human character attempting complex motion created at Information International Inc. In 1974 The New York Institute of Technology (NYIT), in Old Westbury, New York, assembled a computer graphics research group with a notableroster of engineers and programmers. The goal was to develop computer graphics software and hardware to be used for commercial productions. A few years later Indutrial Light & Magic (ILM) was created to develop the visual effects for George Lucas' 1977 Star Wars. This film brought visual effects to the foreground of mainstream culture, but the use of computer technology in this film was mostly limited to the computerized motion control systems used to move cameras and physical  miniature models. The blue-screen compositing of the visual effects elements and plates in these films was achieved optically. In 1979 several members of the NYIT research group joined ILM with the goal of integrating computer graphics into visual effects production.
* The commercial work done for advertising agencies at Digital Effect, III, MAGI, and Robert Abel and Associates is illustrative of computer animation in the late 1970s. These companies were active until the mid-1980s and then spawned other companies that continued their innovative spirit. Digital Effects was active from 1978 until the mid-1980s, III opened in 1974 and closed in 1982, MAGI was active between 1972 and 1987, and Robert Abel and Associates starting in 1971 and closed in 1986.

#### Visual Milestones: 1980s
* In the area of three-dimensional computer animation, the 1980s started with a few exceptional works and ended with a flurry of outstanding projects. This was due to many factors, such as enhanced technology, the larger market, the maturing of the artists workinging in the field, and the entry into the workforce of the first art students who attended computer animation and imaging educational programs. The earliest realistic model of the full human figure from this decade is the virtual character Cindy created in III for the 1981 science fiction film Looker. the 1982 Disney film TRON was the first feature film with over 20 minutes of computer animation composited optically with live action; a few of the shots required dozens of passes with filters in front of the optical printer lens. TRON combined live action with three-dimensional computer animations created by the team at Robert Abel and Associates, III, MAGI, and only moderately successful at the box office. The story behind this science-fiction film centered around a videogame designer who somehow ends up inside the virtual world of his creations and has to fight the game challenges that he himself created. The topic of this film also reflected the fact that the popularity of videogames hit a peak in the early 1980s, when Atari was the leading company in this arena. A decade earlier its founder, Nolan Bushnell, had developed the table tennis game Pong that helped launch the videogame industry.
* In the eara of visual effects for live action film, Industrial Light * Major (ILM) continued the excellence in visual effects started just a few years earlier with George Lucas' The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom became in 1984 their first film to have an all-digital composite shot. Young Sherlock Holmes (1985) featured a somewhat convincing jointed character made of flat stained glass-like panels with texture mapping and transparency. In Flight of the Navigator (1986) keyframes of the live action footage were scanned and used for spherical reflection mapping to simulate interactive reflections as commputer-generated objects travelled through the scene; three-dimensional morphing was also used in this movie. The Abyss (1989) revolved around the first three-dimensional computer animated character that was realistic enough to blend with the live action background plates. Because of the complex calculations of reflection and refraction, the team had enough time to render the different layers in each from only once. The different passes (diffuse, specular, refraction, highlights) were composited optically, except for a single shot (when the safety door closes and the water creature is cut in half) that was composited digitally at 8 bits with Photoshop software.

SECTION II: Modeling

# Chapter 3: Modeling Concepts

## Summary
* The SCULPTING, SPATIAL DESCRIPTION, AND PLACEMENT of virtual three-dimensional objects, environments, and scenes with a computer system is called modeling. This chapter explores the basic concepts of the modeling process, including the numerical description of objects, moving and resizing objects in three-dimensional space, popular file formats, and some practical advice.

## 3.1. Space, Objects, and Structures
* We live in a three-dimensional world. We move among other people, climb mountain, run on the beach, and admire the landscape around use. We go in and out of buildings, walk up and down the stairs, drive through bridges,and grab utensils for writing, cooking, and grooming ourselves. Our daily life happens in three-dimensional environment and is full of three-dimensional objects and characters.We see and feel three-dimensionality all the time. But unless we are involved in an activity or profession that is related to building things, like silverware or furniture, buildings or bridges, we rarely concern ourselves with how our three-dimensional reality is put together and what techniques are used to building it.
* Modeling three-dimensional scenes with a computer program requires that we familiarize ourselves with the large selection of computer software tools used for modeling objects and environments. In 3D computer modeling it is quite common to use a combination of  tools for building jsut one object. For example, think of the difference between a chair that was built using just two tools--a manual saw and a hammer--and a chair that was built with six tools--a thick saw, a thin saw, a lathe, a curve chisel, a hammer, and a sanding tool. It is obvious that while the first chair could have an interesting design, the variety of shapes would be limited and directly related to the skill of the artisan. The second chair would have richer and more refined modeling. The simple conputer-based modeling tools are described in this chapter, and most of the advanced modeling tools are covered in Chapter 4. Now let's step back and talk about some general issues involved in modeling in 3D.
* Many of the basic conventions used in 3D modeling software describing 3D scenes are based on the traditional convensions used in various disciplines. For example, to convey space in a clear and concise way, architects use conventions related to measuring, composition, and sequence. Even the design of a simple rectangular room requires measuring many times so that all the components of the room end up where they were planned to be. Furthermore, to interpret accurately an architect's drawing and build it, masons need to take measurements. Over the ages masons and architects have developed conventions so that they can be precise and clear about measuring spaces, building objects, and arranging them in structures.
* We use similar conventions to describe the dimension, placement, and sequence of objects and environments in a 3D space simulated with a computer program. A beginning builder will soon find out that there are many different methods available for measuring space, and at first this variety can be confusing. But experienced builders ususally find this richness of methods empowering and have the option of using one or another depending on the requirements of the project. Let's start our definition of 3D space with the boundaries that define our workspace or scene. The simplest way to do this is to imagine that we are working inside a large space like a cube or a sphere. We can think of this space as our world or environment. Objects that exist within the space are visible, those that fall out are invisible.
* The main point of reference in the world is called the world origin. The origin is usually located in the center of the space, but it can also be placed or repositioned elsewhere depending on the modeling needs and strategies. For example, if we were building a model of the solar system, it would make sense to have the world origin where the sun is, in the centre, because all the other objects in the system are placed around the sun, and can be easily described in terms of the sun. If we were building an underwater scene and included both fish under the water and boats above the water, we might want to position the origin at the point where air and water meet. In the case of 3D modeli of an airport, the world origin could be placed at ground level, matching the position of the control tower. All 3D spaces have three basic dimensions: width, height, depth. A common method for representing these dimensions in a 3D space is by using arrows or axes. It is common to label the axis representing the width of a 3D space with the letter X, the height axis with letter Y, and the depth axis with the letter Z. The point in space where these three axes intersect, or cross each other, is the world origin.
* The **rectangular coordinate system** can be used to define specific locations and accurately position the points of objects in 3D space. Rene Descartes, an eighteenth-century French philosopher and mathematician, formalized the idea of using three axes labeled X, Y, and Z, to represent the dimensios in 3D space. The coordinate system he devised is commonly referred to as the Cartesian (or rectangular) coordinate system. Each axis in the system can be divided into many units of measurement. In principle these units are abstract values that can represent different units of measurement and scales of dimension. On each axis the values to one side of the origin are positive, and the values on the other side are negative. 
* There are many ways of representing the direction of an axis and, consequently, the directions in which values on that axis are positive or negative. usually though, in what is called a **right-handed coordinate system**, the values of the X axis become larger to the right of the origin, the values of the Y axis increase as they move above the origin, and the value on the Z axis grow as they get closer to us. In the **left-handed coordinate system** the value on the Z axis decrease as they get closer to us. There are several variations of the directionality of the rectangular coordinate system, but most 3D modeling programs use the right-handed coordinate system to describe the virtual world.
* The three axes in the
