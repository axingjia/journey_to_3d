# Preface
* The FOURTH EDITION OF THIS BOOK includes many updates and additions that address the new professional realities faced by three-dimensional computer animators, techhnical directors, and visual effect artists. A lot has changed in this field since this book was first published in 1996. Many of these changes have transformed a field that began as a specialized novelty into a mainstream and mature profession.
* Consider the multiple landmark events that have taken place during the first decade of the 21st century. Desktop computers and graphics cards dominate today the production of computer animation, a world previously ruled by high-end (and high-priced) workstations. Computer networks and the Internet, including the development of streaming video on the World Wide Web, have also become ubiquitous during this period. The number of live-action feature films with significant, often stunning, three dimensional computer animation and visual effects has multiplied. The high power graphics capabilities of today's game consoles are capable of rendering in real time very sophisticated imagery. high definition digital video is a feasible means of moving production, and all digital cinema continues to evolve. The quality of work produced by computer animation and film-making students continues to rise worldwide, with student short films winning countless prestigious awards. Computers are used for virtually every single animated movie, game, or TV series produced today, and it seems like the first all-computer-animated movie, game, or TV series produced today, and it seems like the first all-computer-animated feature film was produced a long time ago, before some of this book's readers were born. 
* Some of the new material that you will find in the book includes:

        * Additional new pages focusing on creative development, story, visual style, and characters.
        * Information on new production pipelines
        * An expanded version of the popular historical timeline of computer animation, visual effects, and technology, including the recent years.
        * over 300 new color images with informative captions, including first-time contributions from Australia, Croatia, Czech, Finland, India, Israel, Hollywood studios, and production houses and independents in Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland Spain, Switzerland, and the United States.
        * New animation principles of anime
        * Updated animation chapters with a focus on blending the traditional animation principles with the digital crafts
        * Countless tips on how to improve the artistic and technical quality of your projects.
        * Updated technical information on the latest stylistic trends and techniques.
        * An updated website at ***www.artof3d.com** containing parts of the book that are available only online, such as the much-read Ten Tips for Digital Artists, and other useful resources.

## Scope of this book
* It would require an encyclopedic work to fully document and present all of the topics and techiques included in this subject. This book does not pretend to be such a work. A significant effort has been made to create a book that is not bound by the particulars of any specific computer program while, at the same time, offers detailed, practical information that goes beyond merere theory. The knowledge contained in this book has been distilled from years of production experience, working and teaching with a variety of software programs, from reading innumerable software manuals, and from practicing and making mistakes. Hopefully, reading this book will help minimize the number of mistakes you make and provide you with the tools to gracefullly recover from them. Welcome to artistic production.

## How to Read this Book
* Mastering the art and craft of three-dimensional computer animation and effects can be achieved in different ways. Likewise, this book can be read in multiple ways.
* For those of you who like the systematic approach I recommend that you read the book from front to back in sequential order, and refer to the illustrations to complement the knowledge presented in the main body of the text.
* for those of you who prefer to learn by doing or are too impatient to read the whole book from start to end, it might be best to look at the picture first. But do not forget to read the captions as you look at the images. There is a lot of useful information contained in them. You might want to read some of the sections in the book that complement the step-by-step procedures that you can find in your software manual. This book contains information rarely found in manuals or presented by instructors in lab courses. This information is more important than it seems at first because it will help you make the transition from being just a technician (AKA button-pusher) in the software program of your choice to being a creative digital animator or artist.

## using this book with Software
* Read the book as you learn and experiment with a specific three-dimensional program or by itself without any hands-on work. To those of you who prefer to learn by reading before you start the hands-on part of learning, this book offers a comprehensive introduction with plenty of theoretical and practice references. Those of you who prefer diving straight into the particulars of a specific computer program--and reading after the fact--will find this book complements your experimental approach by offering clear explanations in a succinct form. Last but not least, to those of you who learn best by combining the experimental approach with conceptual comprehension, this book offers a logical progression of topics that goes beyond the particulars of software manual.

## Book Format
* This book consists of five sections, each with several chapters. The first section includes a historical overview and general creative development and production issues. This section deals with a summary of the major creative and technical trends, a short summary of computer animation and visual effects milestones, and advice regarding the production planning of a project. The introductory section makes you think like a historian, film critic, and producer. Section II goes right into the details of modeling three-dimensional objects and environments. The modeling section makes you think like a sculptor. Section III covers many of the most useful rendering techniques, both simple and complex. The rendering section makes you think like a photographer and painter. The fourth section deals first with many of the issues associated with telling a story through performance, moving pictures and visual effects: basic screenplay writing, storyboarding, and acting techniques for bringing an animated character to life. The animation section makes you think like an actor, a scriptwriter, and a cinematographer. The last section presents issues involved in recording and presenting your work, including sequencing and composing. This section makes you think like an editor and a magician who pulls off the trick right in front of the audience.

## What to Expect from this Book
* This book seeks to inspire and to inform. It presents the concepts required to understand the steps and procedures that lead to the completion of a film, rendered three-dimensional computer animation. Many of illustrations have been developed to present complex concepts in a way that is clear and easy to understand. Considerable effort has also been made so that the book structure and details would be as inclusive as possible: many software programs and hardware platforms were tested and reviewed so that readers find a consistent treatment and point of view. The main goal of this book is to provide the reader with a solid foundation by presenting a unique and unusual combination of technique and creativity.

## What Not to Expect from this Book
* This book is not a computer software manual. It is not based on a particar software program. Readers who seek information regarding the detailed operation of specific software or the implementation of specific techniques are advised to consult software manuals. This book is not a general introduction to the use of computers. it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the basic use of a computer system, or that the reader is in the process of gaining that knowledge elsewhere. Readers who have used computers and who have a basic understanding of the operation of computer systems and are likely to benefit from this book faster than readers who have never before used a computer.

## About Software Manuals
* Software manuals are sometimes tedious to follow and they become obsolete in a flash. The latter is not surprising if we take into account the complexity of software, the constant upgrades of features, adn short production cycles to develop the software and relevant manuals, and turning them into functional and efficient products within a competitive market.
* Having been both a user and a writer of software user manuals I am familiar with the frustrations experienced by both sides. Today's three-dimensional software is so complex and changing that we can not expect a manual to have every single pice of information perfectly digested and updated. My advice is to take the useful information contained in the software manuals and build on it. Some of the nuts and bolts information required to be a proficient digital animator and technician is found in manuals. Some is acquired through practice, trial, and error, or from reading books and magazines and consulting with individuals more experienced than oneself. Learning requires effort.

## General Principles vs. Specific Techniques
* Most of the techniques described throughout the book are available in most of the three-dimensional software programs available on the market. But instead of presenting these modeling, rendering, animation, and output techniques in exactly the same ways they are implemented in a specific computer system, we present them by focusing on their essential features and capabilities. Specific implementations of techniques--implementations that differ from system to system--are left untouched. Readers who wish to obtain highly specific information regarding a particular computer program mentioned in this book are advised to consult their specific software reference manuals.
